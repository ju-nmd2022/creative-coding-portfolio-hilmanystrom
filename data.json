The chnages I made to variate it was to give the flowers different some different shades of pink in a randomized patter! Same thing here with coding structure, I used an example code we did together with Bassima and Garrit during a workshop on the 28/8 as help and a structure to continue build my own code on, and added some more lines and changes in this second version."
