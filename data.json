The chnages I made to variate it was to give the flowers different some different shades of pink in a randomized patter! Same thing here with coding structure, I used an example code we did together with Bassima and Garrit during a workshop on the 28/8 as help and a structure to continue build my own code on, and added some more lines and changes in this second version."

I started with making she squares solid colors and then adding some randomized squares to it to switch things up a litle. I used some of the examples from the lectures, such as the example for Molnars squares and also the particle example which I then added into the molnar-code, and in this second version I added a fading effect with each mouse-click."
